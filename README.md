Hi, this is the README for the frontend side
To build this app i used vite, i created the app like this:

npm create vite@latest app
And then i chose
  -React
  - TypesSript

when you launch it, it should open on localhost:5173 the port may vary in case you have another application running on that port.

You have to do npm install to get the node_modules and be able to run the app

The installed dependencies were:
  -React Router DOM: npm install react router-dom@6
  -React csv : npm install react-csv --save;
  -React Table: npm install react-table react-csv

There is also a deployed version of this project in:
